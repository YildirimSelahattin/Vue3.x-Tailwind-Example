            A home energy rating is an estimated calculation into a homes
            potential energy usage, which will determine the amount of heating
            and cooling required to make its occupants comfortable. It produces
            a star rating dependant on the amount of heating and cooling loads
            which will be required, from 0 to 10 stars.

            In most Australian states the government requires that all new homes
            and apartments (along with certain types of building extensions)
            built since 2010 be energy rated and achieve a minimum of 6 Stars.

            Simple energy rating prices vary greatly on the size and type of
            building, generally an energy rating will cost somewhere between
            $130 to $700+.
